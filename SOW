PROBLEM STATEMENT 
I'm new to web development and Raspberry Pi projects, so I wanted to learn how to build and 
host a simple website using basic tools. My goal was to keep it easy, low-cost, and hands-on by 
using a Raspberry Pi Zero and simple HTML. 
I faced some beginner challenges, like learning how to add an image to my website. But this 
project helped me understand the basics of setting up a web server and writing HTML while I 
kept learning new things.
