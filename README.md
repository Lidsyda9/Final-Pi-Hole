# How to set up a PiHole on a Raspberry Pi - Block All Ads and More! What You Need Below is everything you need to set up your Raspberry Pi to become a fully functional Pi-Hole.

- **A Raspberry Pi** Single-Board Computer (in my case I have used a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB but this can be done perfectly with an earlier lower-spec Pi like the Raspberry Pi 3)
- Micro-SD card: flashed with Raspberry Pi OS
- Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cord to connect the system to a Monitor
- Power Supply
- Mouse and Keyboard
- Ethernet Cable (Can use just Wi-Fi if desired)
- Operational Internet Connected Modem/Router
- Software Build
- If prompted, type and enter | Y | to continue/confirm installations.
- sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

 <strong>curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
 
**follow the defult setting! **: runs smoothly with [Installation_Process_Step_by_step_2](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/prerequisites/)
