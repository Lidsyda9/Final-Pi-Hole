# How to set up a PiHole on a Raspberry Pi - Block All Ads and More! What You Need Below is everything you need to set up your Raspberry Pi to become a fully functional Pi-Hole.

- **A Raspberry Pi** Single-Board Computer (in my case I have used a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2GB but this can be done perfectly with an earlier lower-spec Pi like the Raspberry Pi 3)
- Micro-SD card: flashed with Raspberry Pi OS
- Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cord to connect the system to a Monitor
- **Lightweight**: runs smoothly with [minimal hardware and software requirements](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/prerequisites/)
- **Robust**: a command-line interface that is quality assured for interoperability
- **Insightful**: a beautiful responsive Web Interface dashboard to view and control your Pi-hole
- **Versatile**: can optionally function as a [DHCP server](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-use-pi-holes-built-in-dhcp-server-and-why-would-i-want-to/3026), ensuring _all_ your devices are protected automatically
- **Scalable**: [capable of handling hundreds of millions of queries](https://pi-hole.net/2017/05/24/how-much-traffic-can-pi-hole-handle/) when installed on server-grade hardware
- **Modern**: blocks ads over both IPv4 and IPv6
- **Free**: open source software that helps ensure _you_ are the sole person in control of your privacy
